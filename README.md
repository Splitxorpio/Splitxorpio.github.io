## Inspiration
All of us are fans of the infamous Cookie Clicker, Some of us had always wanted to make something like Cookie Clicker but never got the chance because of school. But this hackathon and with the theme of Entertainment allowed us to not only make a clicker game but possibly the most entertaining clicker game out there. We added a lot of things from the base clicker game mechanics to in-game cosmetics (and Elon Musk, who doesn't love Elon Musk?)

## What it does
ClickerVille looks like a simple clicker game at first, but there are a plethora of things you can do, with the intention to allow people to learn money managing while also having fun, we added things that are related to popular things we do in finance. Most clicker games tend to focus only on clicking and buying products, but we wanted to make you, the user feel like someone who owns a business, you have access to many things like auto-clickers, multipliers, and automatic clicks. But that is not all, we also provide something called the Clicker Market. Which is a Clickerville version of the stock market that you would see in today's world, where you can invest your clicks in 2 stocks, and Clipto currency. To make this we used an RNG to portray real-world situations, the longer you hold, the higher the risk, the shorter-term you hold for, the less the risk. But clicker games lack one thing. Clicker games don't allow the user to be interactive with their game that much, it is just clicking a bunch of buttons. So we made it so there are in-game cosmetics. You can change your cursor and the emoji your click to any of the options we show, allowing you to customize your game to your
liking and ending up increasing your entertainment.

## How we built it
The Frontend was done all with HTML and CSS, and the backend was done with Javascript and browser cookies. Javascript allowed us to make the products you buy to be functional and give 
you clicks every second without having to click the emoji. Javascript allowed us to also create

## Challenges we ran into
Implementing Cosmetics and being able to make the products you buy functional was really hard. Getting the RNG to work the way we want was also really hard, but we were able to overcome these challenges and make the beautiful project that exists as of now.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
This project was really hard, we originally planned to just make it a normal clicker game that
looked visually appealing and less crammed but the fact we added so many features was a huge
success for us, we learned a lot of new things as well, which is very important because that is
the main reason things like hackathons exist, to allow the competitors to learn new things.

## What we learned
- Vidit - Learned HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the first time
- Adithya - Learned HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the first time
- Surya - Learned new HTML and CSS strategies improved his skills in Javascript
- Arnav - Learned new things in Javascript, improved his skills in HTML/CSS

## What's next for ClickerVille
We want to add anti-cheat features so we can prevent things like auto clickers, we also want to implement multiplayer so we can add mini competitions and other fun things.
